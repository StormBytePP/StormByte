/**
 * @namespace StormByte::Type
 * @brief Named concepts and small type utilities used across the suite.
 *
 * Prefer these names in public templates. Do not reintroduce
 * `std::enable_if` / `void_t` traits next to them.
 *
 * Split by @defgroup across `StormByte/type_traits/*.hxx`. Each file
 * `#include`s the group files its own concepts build on (e.g. `detail.hxx`
 * on `categories.hxx`/`object_semantics.hxx`, `enums.hxx` on
 * `categories.hxx`, `ranges.hxx` on `categories.hxx`/`conversions.hxx`), so
 * the list below only needs to be exhaustive, not ordered. Add new concepts
 * to the matching group file, referencing another group's concept directly
 * (plus its `#include`) instead of repeating a raw `std::is_*` check; only
 * add a new file for a genuinely new group.
